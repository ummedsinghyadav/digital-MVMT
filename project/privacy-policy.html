We may display certain advertising offers on the Website or allow service providers, advertisers, ad networks, or other third parties to advertise on the Website. Additionally, we may use third-party software to serve ads on the Website, implement email marketing campaigns, and manage other interactive marketing initiatives. This third-party software may use cookies, web beacons, or similar tracking technology to help manage and optimize your online experience with us.&nbsp;</span></p>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can usually choose to set your browser to disable or reject cookies.

         <p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have implemented measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.</span></p>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.</span></p>
         <p><strong>Policy for Children</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not use the Website to solicit information from or market to children under the age of 18. By using the Website, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children&rsquo;s internet usage and to instruct their children never to provide personal information through the Website or any other website without parental consent. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us via the Website, please contact us and we will use reasonable efforts to locate and delete the information.</span></p>
         <p><strong>SMS Messaging</strong></p>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By signing up to our promotional lists, you are giving your express permission to Digital MVMT and its agents or vendors the right to contact you with targeted advertising materials by email, text message (SMS), telephone or cellphone, including the use of automated, predictive, programmable, or similar automatic dialers or dialing software, or any other means of communication we may utilize to provide promotional offers. Your consent is not a condition of purchase. To the extent applicable, you expressly acknowledge that you are solely responsible for all charges billed by your mobile service provider.&nbsp;</span></p>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you no longer wish to receive promotional communications by email, please follow the unsubscribe link located at the end of an email message. If you no longer wish to receive promotional messages by text, reply STOP, END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, or QUIT to any mobile message from Digital MVMT. We may share your data, including your SMS opt-in or consent status, with third parties that help us provide our messaging services, including but not limited to platform providers, phone companies, and any other vendors who assist us in the delivery of text messages.</span></p>
         <p><strong>Do Not Track Signals&nbsp;</strong></p>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do Not Track (&ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;) is a privacy preference that users can set to have their Internet browser automatically send a signal to our Website to request we not track browsing activity across different sites. There is, however, currently no universal standard for sending and receiving DNT signals. As such, we cannot promise that we respond to all DNT signals but do recognize and respond when required by applicable privacy laws, such as when HTTP header fields or Java objects are used.</span></p>
         <p><strong>Submitting Information from Outside the United States and Transferring Information</strong></p>
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We control and operate the Website and our services from within the United States of America (the &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;). Your information may be transferred to, and processed in, the U.S. or any other country in which our we or our vendors maintain facilities. To the extent applicable, we have taken appropriate safeguards for such transfers and rely on the latest version of the Standard Contractual Clauses promulgated by the European Commission (along with the UK Addendum, where appropriate), for transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland to the U.S. and for onward transfers from the U.S. Note that the English language version of this Privacy Policy is the controlling version regardless of any translation you may attempt.&nbsp;</span></p>
